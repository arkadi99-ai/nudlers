/**
 * Shared types for the anomaly subsystem.
 *
 * A detector takes some input (transactions, recurring patterns…) and returns
 * a list of `DetectedAnomaly` candidates. The evaluator then upserts these
 * into the `anomalies` table, keyed on `fingerprint` to prevent double-flagging.
 *
 * Each detector owns its fingerprint format. Two principles to keep in mind:
 *  1. Same underlying event must produce the same fingerprint across runs
 *     (that's what makes the table idempotent).
 *  2. Different events must produce different fingerprints (otherwise we'd
 *     hide real anomalies under stale ones).
 *
 * Severity guidance:
 *  - high   — user almost certainly wants to see this (price hike, big new
 *             recurring charge). Surfaced in the WhatsApp daily summary.
 *  - medium — interesting but not urgent. Surfaced in WhatsApp summary too.
 *  - low    — borderline; in-app only.
